ï¿½ Case Study: Online Feedback Collection System
 ðŸŽ¯ Scenario:
 A college wants to collect feedback from students on various facilities (library, cafeteria, labs, etc.). 
The system is purely JSP-based, using JSTL and Directives, and stores all data in memory only 
(no database) for demo or local testing.
 ðŸ’¡ Objectives:
 â€¢ Use JSP Directives to include common layouts.
 â€¢ Use JSTL Core Tags to display questions, iterate over submitted feedback, and control 
visibility.
 â€¢ Use EL (Expression Language) to read submitted values and display them dynamically.
 ðŸ“‚ Pages Involved:
 1. index.jsp
 â—¦ A welcome page with a link to start the feedback form.
 2. feedbackForm.jsp
 â—¦ Displays a form with multiple facilities (library, lab, etc.) using checkboxes and text 
inputs.
 â—¦ The form posts to feedbackSummary.jsp.
 3. feedbackSummary.jsp
 â—¦ Uses JSTL <c:forEach> to loop through responses.
 â—¦ Shows feedback based on form input.
 â—¦ If nothing is selected, uses <c:if> to display a "No feedback submitted" message.
 4. thankyou.jsp
 â—¦ Simple thank-you message using EL to greet the user.
 5. header.jsp / footer.jsp
 â—¦ Included using <%@ include %> directive on every page for layout consistency.
